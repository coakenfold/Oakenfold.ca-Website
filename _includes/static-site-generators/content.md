## Static Site Generators

[GatsbyJS](//www.gatsbyjs.org) is a React based static site generator. I successfully developed a [large single page site using GatsbyJS](//watchmojo.com/advertise) for WatchMojo.

The oakenfold.ca website was initially hand coded `html`/`css` but once the codebase became unwieldy due to size and complexity it was switched over to [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com/) with much success.

Static site generators offer a lot of benefits:
- an easy to use yet sophisticated system that meets most business' needs
- code quality increases due to developer tooling and plugins
- static sites typically load faster than single page applications
- website copy can be stored outside of `html` markup for easy updating
- the template loops minimize repetitive typing
- easily group source code by component
