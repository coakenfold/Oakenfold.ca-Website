## Static Site Generators

[GatsbyJS](//www.gatsbyjs.org) is a React based static site generator. I successfully developed a [large single page site](//watchmojo.com/advertise) using GatsbyJS for [WatchMojo](//watchmojo.com) .

The [oakenfold.ca - html/css](//oakenfold.ca/versions/html-css) website was initially hand coded `html/css` but once the codebase became unwieldy due to size and complexity it was switched over to [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com/) with much success.

Static site generators offer a lot of benefits:
- an easy to use yet sophisticated system that meets most business' needs
- code quality increases due to developer tooling and plugins
- static sites typically load faster than single page applications
- website copy stored outside of `html` markup for easy updating
- increased developer comfort:
    - easily group source code by component
    - plugins to handle repetitive tasks
    - code reuse via `includes` or `require`s
    - templating/loops can generate markup
