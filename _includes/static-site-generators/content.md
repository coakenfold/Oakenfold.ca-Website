Successfully developed a large single page website using [GatsbyJS]()/[React]()

This website was initially hand coded html/css but once the codebase became unmanageable I switched it over to [Jeckyll]()

- an easy to use yet sophisticated system that meets most business' needs
- lots of good web performance defaults enabled by design
- code quality increases from developer tools and plugins
- increased developer comfort:
    - easily group source code by component
    - plugins to handle repetitive tasks
    - code reuse via `includes` or `require`s
