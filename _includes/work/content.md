## Experience

At Blast Radius, I worked as an Interface Developer as part of a team, just before their acquisition by WPP group. My portfolio included clients such as Nintendo of America, Microsoft, Starbucks, Nike, BMW, Chanel, Electronic Arts, Standard Pacific Homes, and Guthy Renker.

In 2014, I branched out to create the small, but mighty, corporation Oakenfold Enterprises Ltd. Since, I have collaborated and lead on a variety of projects. Read on to learn more about my work...

Here are some of the things I bring to the table:

- Success working remotely with early stage startups (in the USA)
- Developing and refining features in consultation with project founders and stakeholders
- Contributing features and cleaning up pre-existing codebases
- Delivering sites from alpha > beta > production
- Incorporating new technologies into projects

I am committed to continuous learning.  Currently, I am passionate about [React](//reactjs.org), [web page performance](#perf), and [accessibility](#wcag).
