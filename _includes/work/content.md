## Experience

At Blast Radius, I worked as an Interface Developer as part of a team, just before their acquisition by WPP group. My portfolio included clients such as Nintendo of America, Microsoft, Starbucks, Nike, BMW, Chanel, Electronic Arts, Standard Pacific Homes, and Guthy Renker.

In 2014, I branched out to create the small, but mighty, corporation Oakenfold Enterprises Ltd. Since, I have collaborated and lead on a variety of projects. Read on to learn more about my work...

Here are some of the things I bring to the table:

- Delivering sites from alpha > beta > production
- Developing and refining features in consultation with project founders and stakeholders
- Contributing new UI/UX features to pre-existing or blank slate codebases
- Success incorporating new technologies into projects
- Success working remotely with early stage startups


I am committed to continuous learning.  Currently, I am passionate about [React](//reactjs.org), [web page performance](#perf), and [accessibility](#wcag).
