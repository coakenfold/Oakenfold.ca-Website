## Let’s Meet - Contact Chad Oakenfold

I create “intricate and beautiful complexities” on the shores of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Deeply interested in the intersections between art  culture, design and technology, and identifying as “urban Dene”, I balance my passion for work with a commitment to my young, adventure-loving family.

I am always on the lookout for new opportunities, inspirations, and challenges. Maybe we should work together?
