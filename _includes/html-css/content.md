## HTML, CSS

A large portion of the oakenfold.ca `html`/`css` version was developed by hand coding.

Hand coding `CSS` tends to reduce selector chains and number of declarations.

Hand coding `HTML` tends to reduce the amount of markup generated.

Resulting in a smaller codebase which is maintainable, easy to comprehend, and performant.

WatchMojo asked me to provide a prototype for a new product they were developing. A one page html, css with minimal scripting.

- Created small utility scripts that cloned sample markup in order to populate the page, i.e: `lorem ipsum` for interface elements
- Tested with the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE)
- Tested in a wide range of devices, browsers, and operating systems
