## HTML, CSS

The [oakenfold.ca html/css version](//oakenfold.ca/version/html-css) of the site was initially prototyped with hand coded `HTML` and `CSS`.

Handcoding `CSS` tends to reduce selector chains and number of declarations.

Handcoding `HTML` tends to reduce the amount of markup generated.

Once the the copy and markup became unmanageable, the project was switched to the [Jeckyll](//jekyllrb.com/) static site generator.

[WatchMojo](//watchmojo.com) asked me to provide a prototype for a new product they were developing. A one page html, css with minimal scripting. 

- Created small utility scripts that cloned sample markup in order to populate the page, i.e: `lorem ipsum` for interface elements
