## HTML, CSS

A large portion of the [oakenfold.ca html/css version](//oakenfold.ca/version/html-css) was developed via hand coded `HTML` and `CSS`.

Hand coding `CSS` tends to reduce selector chains and number of declarations.

Hand coding `HTML` tends to reduce the amount of markup generated.

Resulting in a smaller codebase which is maintainable, easy to comprehend, and performant.

[WatchMojo](//watchmojo.com) asked me to provide a prototype for a new product they were developing. A one page html, css with minimal scripting.

- Created small utility scripts that cloned sample markup in order to populate the page, i.e: `lorem ipsum` for interface elements
