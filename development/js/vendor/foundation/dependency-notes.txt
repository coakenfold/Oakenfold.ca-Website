Here are some of the bower component files and a description.
/js/vendor/ 
modernizr.js 
- fastclick.js - You do not need to use fastclick.js, but is is included in the vendor folder as support is built into Foundation. Fast click removes the 300ms delay on click events in mobile environments and must be included in the header of the page.
- jquery.autocomplete.js - this file is not a dependency and was actually included by accident and will be removed in subsequent releases.
- jquery.cookie.js - this cookie extension to jQuery is an optional dependency of Joyride. If you want to use Joyride's cookie functionality you will need to include this library after jquery.
- jquery.js - use this copy of jQuery as the other will be removed in subsequent releases.
- placeholder.js - Placeholder.js is used as a polyfill for older browsers (IE9) to support input inline placeholders. This is not a dependency.

/js/foundation/
- foundation.js - this file is the Foundation library loader, it must be included before you include any of the individual components, it is not an expanded version of the foundation.min.js file.
